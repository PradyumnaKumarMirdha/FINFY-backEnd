   "Banks should focus on bolstering the participation of Indian entities in the rupee derivatives markets, both domestically and internationally, while maintaining a prudent approach, said Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday.",
   "He said despite some progress, the involvement of domestic banks in the derivative markets remained constrained, with only a limited number of active market-makers.",
   "Das said while Indian banks are gradually increasing their presence in the global markets, their footprint remains relatively small. Currently, domestic banks predominantly interact with global market-makers rather than end-clients, and they are yet to establish themselves as significant market-makers globally.",
   "Speaking at the FIMMDA-PDAI Annual Conference on Monday, he said, \u201cParticipation of domestic banks in derivative markets remains limited with only a small set of active market-makers. Participation of Indian banks in global markets is growing but it is quite small.\"",
   "\u201cGoing forward, our focus should be on enhancing and widening the participation of Indian players in markets for rupee derivatives, both domestically and offshore, while being prudent,\u201d Das said.",
   "He further said that the journey towards pricing transparency is ongoing, with room for further improvement. Retail customers still do not receive deals comparable to those offered to larger clients. Effective market-making and precise pricing for smaller transactions on the negotiated dealing system-order matching segment (NDS-OM) (a platform for trading) are essential.",
   "Disparities in pricing between small and large customers in forex (FX) markets exceed what operational factors alone can justify.",
   "Commenting that banks may need to do more to facilitate the use of the FX retail platform, Das said RBI continues to see banking channels being used by certain persons or entities to fund activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. \u201cThis warrants enhanced vigilance by the banks,\u201d he said.",
   "The RBI governor highlighted six areas which call for attention. He said that liquidity within over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, particularly in interest rate derivatives, remains concentrated in a few products. This limits the broader economy's ability to hedge efficiently.",
   "Moreover, the market for credit derivatives, crucial for facilitating lower-rated corporate bonds, has not yet gained significant traction.",
   "\u201cI am, however, happy to note that the first credit-default swap (CDS) transaction \u2014 after issuance of the revised guidelines that came into effect in May 2022 \u2014 was undertaken last week. In many ways, all domestic market participants are yet to fully embrace the new regulatory framework and exploit the opportunities it presents,\u201d he said.",
   "Das said that introduction of bond forwards is being contemplated to empower long-term investors in effectively managing interest rate risks, with draft guidelines issued in December 2023.",
   "\u201cTo foster greater efficiency, application programming interfaces (APIs) for reporting trades to NDS-OM and accessing the request for quote (RFQ) dealing mode are being contemplated. Introduction of bond forwards is being considered to enable long-term investors to manage their interest rate risks efficiently. Draft guidelines in this regard were issued in December 2023,\u201d he said.",
   "Bank treasuries need to scale up their dynamism to utilise the opportunities presented in the context of the recent regulatory reforms. This is critical for achieving efficient market intermediation, effective management of financial risks and alignment of financial variables across different segments and markets, he said.",
   "He said efforts are being made to leverage technology for achieving greater efficiency while meeting the objectives of market reforms. The governor cited the example of RBI Retail Direct and FX Retail where the regulator is exploring the use of technological platforms to expand the reach of financial markets."

   "The co-lending book of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) is expected to reach Rs 1 trillion by June 2024 amid rising interest from partner banks and the benefit of access to funding and diversification, according to CRISIL Ratings.",
   "Ajit Velonie, senior director at CRISIL Ratings, said over the medium term, growth momentum is seen to be healthy at 35-40 per cent annually. In March 2023, the Assets Under Management (AUM) reached about Rs 55,000 crore through the co-lending arrangement.",
   "The partners may increase their focus on other asset classes such as loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and home loans, given higher risk weights for personal loans. In November 2023, the Reserve Bank of India hiked the risk weights on exposure to unsecured credit.",
   "Velonie said co-lending is seen as a win-win for NBFCs and banks, as it allows sharing of risk and rewards. For mid-sized and small NBFCs, the co-lending model provides access to bank funding and works as an avenue for diversification. The model also allows NBFCs to grow in a capital-efficient manner.",
   "For banks, this provides optimal access to niche customers and geographies and also aids them in meeting their priority sector lending targets.",
   "Of the current overall co-lending book, personal loans alone account for about a third of the AUM, followed by housing loans at approximately 20 per cent and unsecured MSME loans and gold loans each making up around 13 per cent of the pie. Secured MSME (including loan against property) and vehicle loans comprise the rest, approximately 20 per cent.",
   "Growth will be supported by controlled asset quality seen so far in the co-lending portfolio of banks and NBFCs. CRISIL emphasises that long-term success hinges on sustaining this quality and monitoring regulatory developments."

   "Banks covered under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) framework must maintain a stock of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover the expected net cash outflows in the next 30 calendar days. Securities eligible for statutory liquidity ratios, like central and state government bonds, are reckoned as HQLA to calculate LCR. Banks have to maintain 100 per cent LCR.",

  "content":[
   "Justifying the recent norms on exchange-traded currency derivatives, the Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Michael Patra said that the relaxation in documentary evidence requirements is being misused by some market participants as implying a lack of underlying exposure, which is incorrect and constitutes a violation.",
   "He said that the RBI's policy on foreign exchange risk management has stayed consistent in recent years, maintaining an unchanged approach. In 2008, when exchange-traded currency derivatives (ETCDs) debuted, they functioned under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. FEMA regulations explicitly outlined that ETCDs are designed exclusively for hedging purposes, indicating the imperative of having an underlying exposure.",
   "\u201cIn 2014, the RBI aimed to facilitate ease of doing business by providing a relaxation. While underlying exposure is still required, for exposures up to 10 million, documentary evidence is not mandatory. Since then, over the next few years, that limit was raised to 100 million just to provide an incentive for market turnover and to expand the size of the market. But the main point is that it is only for hedging, and underlying exposure is a mandatory requirement,\u201d said Patra. \u201cThe January 5, 2024, circular was issued in pursuance of a commitment made in the monetary policy statement of December 2023, in which we stated that there are various stipulations scattered throughout. We will consolidate them into a master direction, and the January 24 circular served as such. It simply reiterated what has been in place since 2014, so there was no change in that. Now, some market participants have been misinterpreting this to mean that a relaxation in documentary evidence is equivalent to having no underlying exposure, which is not the case. And that constitutes a violation of the law,\u201d he added.",
   "ALSO READ:\u00a0RBI to review liquidity coverage ratio framework, issue a draft circular",
   "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday deferred the implementation of norms on exchange-traded currency derivatives (ETCDs) linked to the Indian rupee until May 3, following concerns by investors. The norms were scheduled to take effect starting Friday. Now, rupee-denominated currency contracts traded on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the BSE require underlying exposure. Though traders are not required to provide evidence of underlying exposure for positions up to $100 million, they must confirm the existence of such exposure.",
   "Supplementing Deputy Governor Patra, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated that there have been no changes to RBI's policy, emphasising that the necessity of underlying exposure has always been a fundamental aspect. He clarified that the reasons behind the issuance of recent circulars and the extension of implementation deadlines were in response to market feedback and requests for more time.",
   "\u201cThere is no change pursuant to yesterday's (Thursday) circular or even earlier. There has been no change in RBI's policy. This policy of needing to have an underlying has always been a part of RBI's policy for the last so many years, so there was no change. And this is something that every market player knew. You cannot say that this is something new. If you read the circulars, past circulars very carefully, it has always been there. So, therefore, if somebody says it is new, it is not correct,\u201d he said.",
   "Transactions in currency futures were primarily driven by the retail segment who couldn't transact in OTC markets because banks demanded proof of underlying exposure, which they didn\u2019t have. These retail trades accounted for more than 50 per cent of total transactions and contributed significantly to liquidity in exchange-traded currency futures.",
   "\u201cMajority markets require both segments of participants, the commercials and non-commercials. Even in the overseas market, there is a huge chunk of non-commercials,\u201d said Hitesh Jain, strategist, institutional equities research, YES Securities India. \u201cI really can't really read too much what the RBI members are trying to convey, but I can say there is a need for both segments of the market,\u201d he added.",
   "There was significant volatility in the rupee\u2019s exchange-traded derivatives in the current week as brokers advised their clients to either unwind positions or provide evidence of underlying forex exposure.",
   "\u201cIn the earlier regulation, as DG Patra has said, that provision was there, but there was no cut-off date,\u201d said Ritesh Bhansali, vice-president at Mecklai Financial Services. \u201cThe RBI wanted to ensure there was no excess speculation and they came up with the cut-off date,\u201d he added."
